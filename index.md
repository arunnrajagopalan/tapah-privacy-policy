**Tapah - Clean Eating Tracker**
**Last updated: February 15, 2026**

## Overview

Tapah ("the App") is a food elimination and clean eating tracker for Android. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## Data We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Account information**: When you sign in with Google, we receive your name, email address, and Google account ID.
- **Health and wellness data**: Weight, height, sleep quality, stress levels, protein intake, body scores, symptom tracking (type and severity), and daily notes you enter.
- **Food data**: Foods you track, test results (trigger/mild/safe), custom foods you create, and testing schedules.
- **Program data**: Elimination program settings, goals, phase progress, and compliance records.
- **Preferences**: Weight unit, reminder times, notification settings.

### Information Collected Automatically

- **Analytics**: We use Firebase Analytics to collect app usage data such as screens viewed, features used, and general interaction patterns. This helps us improve the App. Analytics data is associated with a random identifier, not your personal identity.
- **Crash reports**: We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash logs and stack traces in release builds only. This helps us fix bugs and improve stability.
- **Advertising data**: We use Google AdMob to display banner ads. Google may collect device identifiers and usage data to serve ads. We do not share your health data with advertisers.

### Information We Do NOT Collect

- Location data
- Contacts or phone data
- Photos or camera data
- Data from other apps on your device

## How Data Is Stored

- **Locally on your device**: All health data, food records, program data, and daily logs are stored locally in a database on your device. This data does not leave your device unless you opt in to cloud sync (premium feature, when available).
- **Google servers**: Analytics events, crash reports, and ad interaction data are sent to Google's servers via Firebase and AdMob.
- **Authentication**: Your Google sign-in credentials are managed securely by Google's authentication services.

## How We Use Your Data

- To provide the core App functionality (tracking foods, symptoms, programs)
- To send you daily reminder notifications (if enabled)
- To improve the App through aggregated analytics
- To fix crashes and bugs via crash reports
- To display ads (free tier)

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following Google services, each governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy):

- **Firebase Authentication** - Sign-in
- **Firebase Analytics** - Usage analytics
- **Firebase Crashlytics** - Crash reporting
- **Google AdMob** - Advertising
- **Google Play Billing** - In-app purchases

We do not sell, trade, or share your personal or health data with any third parties beyond the Google services listed above.

## In-App Purchases

Subscription purchases are processed through Google Play. Payment information is handled entirely by Google. We store only your subscription status and expiry date locally.

## Data Retention and Deletion

- **Account deletion**: You can delete your account from the Profile screen. This permanently removes all your data from the App, including health records, food data, and program history.
- **Sign out**: Signing out revokes your authentication. Your local data remains on device until you delete the app or your account.
- **Uninstalling**: Removing the App deletes all locally stored data.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Security

Your data is stored locally on your device. All communication with Google services uses encrypted HTTPS connections. We do not operate our own servers.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
